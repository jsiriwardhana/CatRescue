# CatRescue
A cat rescue website for adoption of rescued cats
----------------

We are planning to convert this website template into a online rescued cat adoption website. There are many cat rescues out there that cannot find adopters due to covid pandamic. With this project we aim to help them by provide them with a free website template that they can use to make the cat adoption process online. 

As the initial step I have found a bootstrap theme we can strip down and create a funcional website. Let's build this together. 

What is needed
------
1. A Front Page slider

2. About us page

3. Contact us page with contact form & google map integration

4. Cats Profiles page to display all cats that are available for adoption
